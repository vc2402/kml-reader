Golang KML Reader aims to be an complete package to perform all read operations
with KML.
For now, there are many packages that writes KML documents, but no one
(as far as I can see) that works on reading KML data.
This package is going to be an working in progress, if you need anything,
please let me know for me to build your needs.

If you want to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request.

Installing the package is pretty simple, you just need to execute the
following `go get` command:
